Hi I'm Nik and welcome to my blog. Here you'll find write-ups and discussions of my data science projects, most of which can be found on [github](https://github.com/nik-davis/).

This blog is meant to be a learning experience for me and any who may come across it, so I very much welcome any comments or suggestions you may have for improvements to my work.

Much of the inspiration for layout and design came from the incredible [Pythonic Perambulations](http://jakevdp.github.io/) ([source](https://github.com/jakevdp/jakevdp.github.io-source)) and [Daniel Rodriquez](https://danielfrg.com/) ([source](https://github.com/danielfrg/danielfrg.com)) blogs. If you're interested in setting up your own blog, you may find [this](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/) post from Jake Vanderplass' blog and [this](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-setup-a-data-science-blog/) post from Dataquest useful.

Thanks for stopping by, and if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask.
